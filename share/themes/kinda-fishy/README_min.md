#### kinda-fishy

A theme based on [fishy](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes#fishy) with two differences:

- The full path is shown instead of abbreviated directory names.
- `$USER@$HOST` is not shown for the local machine, only for SSH sessions and
  inside docker containers (in that case it is `$USER@docker`)
