A theme with a CRT terminal feel.

Notes: If you want to get the full retro experience, include export LSCOLORS=cxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcxcx in your .zshrc file to make the output of ls green as well. You could also play around with the Preferences in Terminal or iTerm or the settings in any terminal of your choice to pimp the look up further.
Features:

- Colored input to shell to easily differentiate it from the output of commands.
- Current git branch being checked out indicated at the end of the prompt.
- Option to keep/hide the virtual environment name.
- Prominent alert on command exiting with non-zero code.
- Dashed line separating successive prompts.
