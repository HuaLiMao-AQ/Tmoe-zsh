If long prompts annoy you, this theme is for you!
It does away with the long path after the username, and retains only the basename of the current working directory in the prompt.

Features:

- Colored input to shell to easily differentiate it from the output of commands.
- No annoying long prompts.
- Option to keep/hide the virtual environment name.
- Prominent alert on command exiting with non-zero code.
