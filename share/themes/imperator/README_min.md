#### Imperator

![imperator theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LinuxGogley/Linux-Mods/master/Shell-Themes/Screenshot_2016-11-28_17-48-18.png)

An adaptation of the mortalscumbag theme. Its modification no longer has the hostname next to the username on the prompt and has a better differentiation of colors by highlighting the user, working directory, and shell sign. The theme also keeps the error number within brackets, as well as a running header stating whether the user is under an ssh connection.
