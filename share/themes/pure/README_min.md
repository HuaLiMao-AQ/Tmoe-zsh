# Pure
> Pretty, minimal and fast ZSH prompt
## Overview
Most prompts are cluttered, ugly and slow. We wanted something visually pleasing that stayed out of our way.
### Why?
- Comes with the perfect prompt character.
  Author went through the whole Unicode range to find it.
- Shows `git` branch and whether it's dirty (with a `*`).
- Indicates when you have unpushed/unpulled `git` commits with up/down arrows. *(Check is done asynchronously!)*
- Prompt character turns red if the last command didn't exit with `0`.
- Command execution time will be displayed if it exceeds the set threshold.
- Username and host only displayed when in an SSH session or a container.
- Shows the current path in the title and the [current folder & command](screenshot-title-cmd.png) when a process is running.
- Support VI-mode indication by reverse prompt symbol (Zsh 5.3+).
- Makes an excellent starting point for your own custom prompt.
