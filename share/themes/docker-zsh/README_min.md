#### Docker-ZSH

This theme is pretty much based on the 'bureau' theme. It has been extended by a `DOCKER_HOST` live view,
so that in every terminal session you see immediately which docker host is configured and where the local
docker commands are forwarded to.
If the `DOCKER_HOST` variable is not set in the terminal session, it's showing a green `local` text what can b
interpreted as a personal local test environment. If a remote host is defined it will show the address in `red`.
