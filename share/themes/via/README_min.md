#### Oh-My-VIA

A theme for ZSH that is heavily inspired by the historical theme used on [VIA Centrale RÃ©seaux](https://via.l4th.fr/) servers. It is designed to be as simple as possible, but still complete enough to be used on production servers and highly configurable to suit any of your desire.

See [Repo](https://github.com/badouralix/oh-my-via) for source & documentation.
